# Ingredient & Instruction Classifier

This repository contains a TensorFlow model and example express server for classifying sentences as either ingredient, instruction, or other.

This is particularly useful when pulling recipe information from a site (see https://github.com/julianpoy/recipeclipper ).

## Usage

The TensorFlow model exists in the `model` folder. The `src/server.js` file provides an example of usage.

The example server can easily be spun up with docker-compose.
